# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## PROMPTS

### Prompt Type 1: Creative Writing Prompt

Prompt:

"Write a short story about a robot that learns to feel emotions."

Tool A: ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Output:

ChatGPT generated a story about a robot named "Eli" who was assigned to a child with autism. Through repeated interactions, Eli began mimicking human emotions until he experienced real empathy. The story ended with Eli shedding a tear during a goodbye hug.

Tool B: Gemini (Google)

Output:

Gemini told a story about a robot on Mars, named "Unit-47", who after years of isolation develops a sense of loneliness and writes poems to cope. The story had a philosophical tone.

Analysis:

•	ChatGPT focused on emotional development through human interaction (warm, heart-touching).

•	Gemini focused on existential emotion in solitude (poetic, introspective).

•	Conclusion: ChatGPT’s output was more emotionally engaging, Gemini's more abstract and artistic.

### Prompt Type 2: Technical Explanation Prompt

Prompt:

"Explain how blockchain technology works in simple terms."

Tool A: ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Output:

ChatGPT explained it like a digital ledger where every transaction is a “block” linked to the previous one. It used a bakery metaphor to make it relatable.

Tool B: Gemini (Google)

Output:

Gemini described it as a decentralized system of records shared across a network, with examples of Bitcoin and transparency applications in voting.

Analysis:

•	ChatGPT prioritized simplicity and metaphor (ideal for beginners).

•	Gemini used real-world applications and focused more on decentralization.

•	Conclusion: ChatGPT wins for teaching a novice, Gemini is better for someone with light background knowledge.

### Prompt Type 3: Image Interpretation Prompt (with a descriptive image text since tools may not always support image input)
Prompt:

"Describe the mood and elements of a photo showing a foggy forest with a lone figure walking on a trail."

Tool A: ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Output:

ChatGPT described it as "mysterious and melancholic", emphasizing isolation, muted colors, and the stillness of nature.

Tool B: Gemini (Google)

Output:

Gemini called it "eerie and poetic", highlighting symbolism—the lone figure representing a journey into the unknown.

Analysis:

ChatGPT described the scene literally with emotional cues.

Gemini interpreted the image symbolically, adding a philosophical edge.

Conclusion: Both were strong, but ChatGPT was better at painting a mood, Gemini better at deeper meaning.
